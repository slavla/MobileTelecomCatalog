We were working with Copilot on a Mobile Telecom Services Catalog project sample, 
split into a backend using Flask and a frontend using Vue.js. 
The backend handles the catalog data and routes, while the frontend uses components to display this data. 
Weâ€™re making sure the frontend can fetch data from the backend and display it with functionalities like sorting and filtering. 
User may select type of Customer: Residential/Business/Partner and have different pricing and availability of products in catalog
